const id = req.params.id; What does this means

In the context of a Node.js application using a framework like Express, the code snippet const id = req.params.id; is used to extract a parameter from the URL. Let me break it down:

req is an object representing the HTTP request, short for "request." In the context of Express, it contains information about the incoming HTTP request, such as headers, parameters, body, etc.

.params is a property of the req object in Express that contains an object with properties mapped to the named route parameters. In Express, you define route parameters in your route paths, like /users/:id, where :id is a parameter.

id is a variable that is assigned the value of the id parameter from the URL. So, if the URL is something like /users/123, then id will be assigned the value "123".

Here's an example of how this might be used in an Express route:

const express = require('express');
const app = express();

app.get('/users/:id', (req, res) => {
    const id = req.params.id;
    res.send(`User ID: ${id}`);
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
    console.log('Server is running on port 3000');
});
In this example, when a GET request is made to a URL like /users/123, the id parameter is extracted from the URL, and the response will be "User ID: 123".
